This implementation resulted in a 15% improvement in operational efficiency.
                    
                    In addition to new development, I was also responsible for maintaining and updating existing websites. One notable project was the enhancement of the company website, where I introduced new functionalities and updated sections such as the <a href="https://arisen.in/ads/" target="blank">Arisen ads section</a> to improve usability and engagement.<br> <br>
                    
                    Beyond web development, I worked on <b>data analysis using SQL and Tableau</b>, creating dashboards that provided insights for better decision-making.  <br> <br>

                    Collaboration was a crucial part of my role, as I worked closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality projects on time.
