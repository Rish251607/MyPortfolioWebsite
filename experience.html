                <p> <b> <i> Software Developer, Arisen Technologies, Noida (18<sup>th</sup> March 2024 – 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2025)  </i></b> <br>
                    At Arisen Technologies, I played a crucial role in developing user-friendly and efficient web applications. I gathered and analyzed requirements to design websites that aligned with business goals and ensured timely project delivery. My work involved full-stack development, including creating responsive front-end interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while optimizing server-side operations using PHP and MySQL.  <br> <br>
                    
                    One of my key contributions was the development of an internal <b>CRM system </b>, which streamlined company operations by incorporating role-based access, workflow automation, tracking, and prioritization mechanisms. This resulted in a <b>15% improvement in efficiency</b>. Additionally, I was responsible for <b>enhancing and maintaining the company website</b>, including updates to the <a href="https://arisen.in/ads/" target="blank">Arisen ads section</a>, improving functionality and user engagement.   <br> <br>
                    
                    Beyond web development, I worked on **data analysis using SQL and Tableau**, creating dashboards that provided insights for better decision-making.  <br> <br>
                    
                    <b> <i> Computer Teacher, Ratan Prem DAV Girls Inter College, Aligarh (2<sup>nd</sup> March 2022 – 15<sup>th</sup> February 2024)  </i> </b> <br>
                    As a computer teacher, I designed and delivered engaging lessons on <b>Computer Basics and MS Word</b> for 9th and 10th-grade students. My approach emphasized practical learning to enhance student understanding and retention.  <br><br>
                    
                    A key achievement was <b>managing academic records using Excel</b>, ensuring efficient tracking of student progress and attendance. My structured data management practices improved accessibility and organization for academic purposes.  <br><br>
                    
                    <b> <i> Analyst Club (Part-Time) </i> </b> <br>
                    To expand my analytical skills, I joined an <b>Analyst Club</b>, where I gained hands-on experience with <b>case studies, guestimates, data analysis, Excel, and Tableau</b>. This helped me refine my problem-solving abilities and deepen my understanding of business intelligence tools.  
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, my experience blends software development, data analysis, and teaching, showcasing my versatility and problem-solving skills in both technical and academic domains.
